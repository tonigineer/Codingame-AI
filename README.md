# Using a Neural Network in a Bot Game on Codingame

After competing in multiple challenges on Codingame with bots using simple heuristics, it's time for something new: the goal is to learn and advance to the Gold league in an upcoming challenge.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> "Codingame doesn't have NN specific libraries. For Codingame people mostly train locally using NN libraries, and just copy the learned weights and implement the forward propagation themselves in their language." - [jacek](https://www.codingame.com/profile/f0c03de45623ce8d5e05cf647e381a807876313) from [Codingame](https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/59631/neural-network-xor-example-from-scratch-no-libs)

## 1️⃣ Check feasibility with Python

Using the [MNIST](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/mnist) dataset to train a simple Neural Network with [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/keras_example) and then transferring the parameters to a Neural Network implemented from [scratch](https://www.kaggle.com/code/wwsalmon/simple-mnist-nn-from-scratch-numpy-no-tf-keras/notebook).

```shell
git clone ??? ~/journey && cd ~/journey
python feasibility/example_tf.py
```

## 2️⃣ Implemented Neural Network in Rust

Todo
